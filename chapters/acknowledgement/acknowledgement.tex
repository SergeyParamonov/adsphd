\chapter{Acknowledgements} \label{ch:ack} I would like to say a big THANK YOU to everyone who has been involved into making this happen: to all my friends and colleagues who have been an enormous support to me.  
First and foremost, I would like to thank Luc De Raedt, my promoter, my scientific perception is shaped by his vision and expertise that he share with me over these years. This work would not have been possible without your help and ideas. Working with you has taught me to see a bigger picture and find next goals worth spending time and energy. This has showed me what it is like to be a researcher.

A special mathematical thank you goes to Marc Denecker. It might seem that Marc is always at the department but in fact he is always somewhere in  a beautiful mathematical world that we do not see. This work would not have been possible without great presents, ideas from this mathematical world, that he sometimes has brought back to me. I am extremely grateful for being able to see even parts of this wonderful world.

I am also grateful to the members of my jury. I am glad at the very beginning of my PhD I worked with Matthijs van Leeuwen. Working with him showed me the field of data mining, his comments and advice on setting and describing experiments have been priceless. Many insights in modeling have come from working with Gerda Janssens, I am grateful for all discussions we had on IDP and graph mining. The work on sketching would not have been possible without great help and advice on constraint modelling from Christian Bessiere. I have greatly improved my knowledge and the text on constraint learning for that I would like to thank Helmut Simonis. I am also grateful to Karl Meerbergen for his insights and comments on relational factorization. And last but not least, I would like to thank Hilde Heynen for being my chairman.

I have had a great pleasure of working with wonderful people at computer science department. What was really special to me is that were not just colleagues but friends as well. Irma and Anton were the main forces driving our small community of friends at the department. Jessa is the person binding it all together in Leuven and I am really glad to be your friend. Francesco -- kernels. Evgeniya for all wonderful weekend coffees we had. Sebastijan and Nikolina for the summer school and all fun events you have organized for us. I am grateful to Kurt for his help that always comes when needed. To Samuel, for all great work we have done together and making it fun to be in the office. To Ondrej and Gitte for showing that you can always come back after you have disappeared. To Pedro for telling us all the stories that happen to him. To Antoine for his support of any party happening in Leuven. To Ann for showing us geocaching. To Behrouz for teaching us about introverts. To Vladimir for being the first person to welcome me in Leuven and show everything around, and to Leen for taking care of him. To Stefano for showing me the most random object in the world: I still completely accidentally remember it from time to time. To Joana, for suddenly appearing and saving Anton. To Mohit, Nitesh, Arrchit, Guy, Tim, Vincent, Tom, Jonas, Killian, Ellia, Robin, Bogdan for all coffees we have at the department. A special thank you is to Tias, for being simultaneously colleague, advisor, friend, FOSDEM org and a circus teacher. To Ben, for showing that you can complain all the time and still look like a happy person at the same time. To Siegfried for guiding me through the pattern mining world, while playing volleyball and telling all the conference travelling stories.

Once I started joining volleyball on Thursday evenings, it has a special place in my heart. Not only because of the game but because of all wonderful people I have met there: Luc, Wim, Bertram, Inge, Hanne, Marteen, Vera, Frank, Bram, Irena, Cyrielle, Arturo, \dots . This has been a wonderful tradition of meeting you and I plan to continue that. 

I am especially grateful, to my EMCL friends who have been my support for many years already. To Alina for all journeys, stories and help, it is always great to have friends like you. To Peter and Ronald, we might not see each other for years and once we meet, it feels like we saw each other yesterday. 

To people at Sentiance who showed great interest in what I do, especially to Vincent and Bertrand for believing in me even before I finished this work. And to Jean for being a great help, especially random things.

To my Phystech friends, after all these years we keep in touch. Maxim, Michael, Konstantin and Yuri: every time I am travelling to Russia, I am glad to see you.

Throughout my PhD, I have met a lot of interesting people, especially at summer school and various events. I was especially excited to meet people at the summer schools of science and I am grateful to Tamara to showing that Chemistry can be fun and talking through thesis writing frustrations. To Raffael and Agnieszka for showing me London during my conference stay. To Aleksandra for talking and being with me when it has been really needed. To Daria and Pauli for believing in my ideas in structured pattern mining.

When I was six years old, I have met Kirill and Olga. You have been great a support in everything I do and you still are.

Last but not least I would like to thank my family. I do not whom would I have been and where without Irina. She has been my support for all these years. To my sister Olga for talking and supporting me. My infinity gratitude to my parents for creating an environment in which I could grew and realize what I liked in life.
